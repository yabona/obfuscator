# obfuscator
## Add noise to your profile... 
This is less a tool, and more an experiment in adding noise and nonsense to a user's web search history. Since so much relies on google search history to track us, I intend to muddle and confuse the algorithms that provide those analytics. By adding constant traffic, it becomes easy to "hide" in the white-noise. 

It's very likely that search providers have a way to see around this. It's also quite likely that this violates their terms and conditions. It's also likely that their collection and use of such metrics is unethical. Call it a tie if you will. 

Personally, I have a dedicated VM on the same hypervisor system that runs my virtual firewall, with an internal "DMZ" virtual network between them. This honeypot VM sits there idly running Obfuscator all day and night to mask my use times and patterns. Again, no way to prove this works. 

If it's okay for serivice providers to sell my data, I figure it's only fair I have the right to devalue it. 

Think $Zimbabwe, but with search metrics. 

Ya boi, Yabones, out. Have fun and be responsible. 

PS. I guess just apply GPL3 to this project. The more people doing this sort of thing the better, in my opinion. As the kids say, IDGAF just give me credit for my work.
